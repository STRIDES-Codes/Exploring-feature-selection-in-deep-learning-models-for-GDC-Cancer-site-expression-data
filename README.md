## *Exploring Feature Selection for Genomics Expression Profile*


### Scope/questions: 

NCI-DOE collaboration (https://github.com/ravichas/ML-TC1) show that expression profiles collected from different cancer sites can be modeled (classification) using the deep-learning (convolutional neural network) method. The method works well for a balanced dataset. What is not clear is, the neural network method doesn't answer what features (i.e. genes) are important and provide a signal to the model? A project to explore feature selection for genomics data could be useful for cancer research communities.

### Complexity of the problem:

* Genomics data is high dimensional in terms of the number of genes/probes/features
* Identifying important genes is as important as building high accuracy models
* 

## Overview 
* Data collection 
  * Data will be collected from GDC. 
  * We will be collecting several datasets (cancer sites that have same lineages and different lineages)
* Datasets will be used to construcct/compare several supervised and unsupervised models. 
* Important features will be extracted and compared with experimental findings
* Conclusions
* Future directions
